## Purpose
Convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal using a bike trip analysis.
Data visualizations for the analysis will include the following:
- Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders- 
- Number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary
Most of the riders are males in busy tourist areas who are 20-30 yrs old. They ride most of the time at Thursdays at 5-7pm, weekdays at 8-9pm, Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays at 5-7pm, and Saturdays and Sundays during the middle of the day (10am-5pm). Bike trips last around 10 minutes.

In implementing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, it's important to consider that bikes would have to be made available in busy areas to have the most successful program. Bikes should also be made available according to the peak times they are used to ensure that everyone can access a bike even during those times. According to the "When are people riding?" visualization, during the most popular bike-riding time of Thursdays at 5-7pm, there are about 30,000 to 31,000 bikes rides. I would suggest also looking into how often and how long certain bikes are used in order to ensure there is proper maintenance provided for bikes and users always have a good bike to use. Additionally, looking into if there are preferences for certain bikes according to user type, gender, or age. Further investigations can then be done to find out why certain bikes may be preferred or not preferred and steps can be made to optimize users' bike-riding experiences.
